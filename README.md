# AnalyzingYouTubeVideos
##### Analyzing factors that affect a YouTube video's popularity

This project was created for the subject "Big Data Management", which was a team project I made with Polyxeni Motsi (@xeenia), and Savvas Stouppos (@Savaskos). We were given CSV files which had data about trending YouTube videos collected from August 2020 through January 2023, such as the title of the video, channel title, trending date, view count, likes, dislikes, video id, etc. The CSV files were converted into JSON files in order to import them to MongoDB. The purpose of the project was to answer queries in MongoDB with the help of the pipelining stages, and come to a conclusion about these answers through statistical representation.
